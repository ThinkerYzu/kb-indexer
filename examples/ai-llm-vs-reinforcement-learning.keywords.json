  "title": "AI: LLMs vs Reinforcement Learning - Richard Sutton's Perspective",
  "summary": "Richard Sutton, father of reinforcement learning and Turing Award winner, argues that Large Language Models are a dead end for achieving AGI. He advocates for experience-based learning through perception-action-reward cycles, similar to how animals learn, rather than imitating human knowledge through text prediction. Sutton positions AGI development as a cosmic evolutionary step from biological replication to designed intelligence.",
